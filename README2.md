# IM App Traffic Analysis Project

Welcome to the IM App Traffic Analysis Project! This project aims to delve into the world of Instant Messaging (IM)
apps, exploring their traffic patterns to uncover potential security vulnerabilities and privacy concerns. Our goal is
to provide valuable insights into the security landscape of these apps, ultimately contributing to a safer digital
communication environment.

## Project Overview

In this project, we analyze data collected from various IM apps to examine their traffic behavior. We investigate
whether the perceived security of these apps aligns with the actual security measures in place. By studying the patterns
and interactions within the traffic, we aim to raise awareness about potential privacy risks and vulnerabilities that
might compromise user data.

## Key Features

- Data Collection: Gather traffic data from a diverse range of IM apps.
- Traffic Analysis: Thoroughly analyze traffic patterns, encryption protocols, and security measures.
- Vulnerability Identification: Identify potential security vulnerabilities and privacy risks.
- Insights and Findings: Share insights and findings with the community through documentation and reports.

## Getting Started
### Basic Instractions
<ol class="getting-started-list">
    <li>Clone the repository:
        <pre><code class="language-sh">git clone https://github.com/LielYoash/NetworksFInalProject.git</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Installation:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Install Wireshark:</strong> Download and install Wireshark from <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" target="_blank">wireshark.org</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Install Python Interpreter:</strong> If not already installed, get Python from <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">python.org</a>.</li> preferably Python version 10
        </ul>
    </li>
<li>Data Collection:
        <ul>
            <li>Open Wireshark and start capturing network traffic.</li>
            <li>Use relevant filters to capture traffic from the IM apps you want to analyze.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Analysis:
        <ul>
            <li>Review captured data using Wireshark to identify relevant packets.</li>
            <li>Utilize Python scripts in this repository to process captured data:</li>
            Choose one out of the 3 paths:
                <ul>
                <li>Export a size by time graph</li>
                <li>Export a PDF graph</li>
                <li>Export a CCDF graph</li>
                </ul>
        <li>Run the program.</li>
       </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Results:
        <ul>
            <li>Visualize findings and insights from the analysis using graphs and charts.</li>
